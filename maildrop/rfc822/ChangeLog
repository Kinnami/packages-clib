* Yes, I've decided to start a Change Log. librfc822 now has a life of its
own, so it might as well have it.

* Courier needs tokens in a link list, not an array.  Rewrote most token
handling code.

* Fixed some issues with handling of () comments.

* Changed *pr* functions to pass along a caller-provided void, also for
  courier.  librfc822 should now be threadable (like, who cares...)

* Added a testsuite
